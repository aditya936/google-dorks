## ðŸ”§ Top Sites security.txt Recon (To Be Automated Soon)

> I plan to create a bash script to automate this process soon.

Steps:

1. Download top 1,000,000 domains from [Cloudflare Radar](https://radar.cloudflare.com/domains)
2. Check both `/security.txt` and `/.well-known/security.txt` for each domain
3. Store the paths in a file (e.g., `paths.txt`)
4. Run the following commands:

```bash
cat domains.txt | httpx -path paths.txt -mc 200 -cl -ct -o result1.txt
cat domains.txt | while read d; do echo "www.$d"; done | httpx -path paths.txt -mc 200 -cl -ct -o result2.txt
